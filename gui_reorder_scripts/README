Changes to the GUI for the next gvsig-1.12 release. Basically, it changes the order in menus and icons. Thanks to fpsampayo for the work!


=== INSTRUCTIONS TO TEST NEW GUI ===
To test this, you must unzip the attached zip folder "extensions".

**WARNING**: Back up the gvSIG folder "extensiones"  or else all the "config.xml". They will be overwritten!!!


=== INSTRUCTIONS TO USE SCRIPTS ===

The python scripts are used to generate the CSV files to analyze and modify a spreadsheet from the configuration files (config.xml) with all the menus and toolbars buttons gvSIG.

To use it you must run from the command line in the 'extensions' of gvSIG to analyze:

$ python parse_gvSIG_config.py

The script will generate multiple tables CSV to '/ tmp' with all the extensions that are loaded in the installation of gvSIG. Also, That extracts data priority, icons, tooltips, etc. buttons and menus.

You can easily change the order and other settings from a convenient spreadsheet: priorities and keyboard shortcuts, and so on.

To implement these changes, run on the command line:

$ python write_gvSIG_config.py

This overrides the config.xml with the new values ​​changed.
(Attention!! Works more or less and sometimes there are little things to tweak by hand).
